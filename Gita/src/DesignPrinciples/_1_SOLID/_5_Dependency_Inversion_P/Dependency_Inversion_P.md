# SOLID
* D = Dependency Inversion Principle

“High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions”

(RISHIK)
-
matlab, classes should rely on abstractions (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes) rather than concrete implementations.

we should always try to make interface and object with the help of interface or abstraction

- more flexible and decoupled code
