# SOLID 
* S = Single Responsibility Principle
* O = Open/Closed Principle
* L = Liskovâ€™s Substitution Principle
* I = Interface Segregation Principle
* D = Dependency Inversion Principle

The SOLID principle helps in reducing tight coupling. Tight coupling means a group of classes are highly dependent on one another which you should avoid in your code.
- Opposite of tight coupling is loose coupling and your code is considered as a good code when it has loosely-coupled classes.
- Loosely coupled classes minimize changes in your code, helps in making code more reusable, maintainable, flexible and stable.

eske liye set of rules hai 5, jo ki use ker sakte hia
ye sara rules 1 code me follow hona cahiye.
