# SOLID
* S = Single Responsibility Principle

“A class should have only one reason to change”

(RISHIK)
-
matlab every class should have a single responsibility or single job or single purpose.
Ek single class 1 particular work ke alawa kuch nahi kerna cahiye,
Agar multiple work ker raha to sabka seperate class hona cahie
- multiple reason, agar class alag alag hoga to resuablity badh jayega
- class bulty nahi dikhega
- changes ko identify kerna asan hojayega
