# SOLID
* 0 = Open/Closed Principle

“Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification”

(RISHIK)
-
matlab "open for extension", "closed for modification" -> wo bina code change kiye extra chij ko accept kare
jase agar koi circle ka class bana raha, to wo rectangle aur sqaure accept nahi karega,
pr agar koi direct shape kerke class banayega to wo sab accept karega aur code bhi change nahib kerna hoga.

- multiple reason, resuablity badh jayega
